      <p>I am currently working on Tall and Skinny QR (TSQR) factorizations in MapReduce frameworks. 
        My CS 267 (Applications of Parallel Computing) project investigated TSQR using Hadoop on Magellan, a cloud testbed at NERSC.
        Currently, I am working on data serialization methods to speed up the Hadoop job times.
        I collaborate with 
	<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/">Professor David Gleich</a>.

	The GRIF project is part of the Berkeley Applied Research on the Imaging of Neutrons and Gamma-rays
	<a href="http://bearing.berkeley.edu/">(Bearing)</a> group, 
	which is a subset of the Domestic Nuclear Threat Security Initiative
	<a href="http://donuts.berkeley.edu/">(Donuts)</a>.  
	My advisors are
	<a href="http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/People/Daniel_Chivers">Dr. Dan Chivers</a>
        and Dr. Mark Bandstra.  The Bearing group is an interdisciplinary 
	effort by students and researchers in nuclear engineering, (astro)physics, mathematics, 
        electrical engineering, and computer science that works on problems in nuclear
        detection.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am developing a parallel, multi-platform software framework for gamma-ray imaging 
        that is used for nuclear detection.  The project is designed to be flexible enough for researchers
        outside of our group to adopt as a common model for detector software support.
        I have worked on data analysis, backend architecture, and code generation techniques for the project.
        The code generation allows end-users to tweak system parameters during run-time. The
        picture below shows 15 channel reads that are updated in near-real-time in parallel.

	For the IEOR department, my advisors were 
	<a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~hochbaum/">Professor Dorit Hochbaum</a>

	I performed research on algorithmic methods for computational biology.  Specifically, I looked
	at MRI sequences provided by the OsteoArthritis Initiative
	<a href="http://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/">(OAI)</a>.  
	The OAI has an open database of knee scans along with accompanying data about the patients. The patients 
	were followed over a 48-month period, and data is available over different visits over the time interval. 
	This turns into a large data mining project for a community of researchers in engineering, computer science, and medicine. 
	Below are two examples of how the images can be cut (using the pseudoflow maximum flow algorithm) to look at the cartilage 
        or bone segment of the image.
