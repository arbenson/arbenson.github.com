	<h4><a name="bebop">MapReduce TSQR and Cholesky QR</a></h4>
	with <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/">Professor David Gleich</a> (Purdue), 
	<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/">Professor James Demmel</a> (UC-Berkeley),

	<br />
	<p>We are currently working on Tall and Skinny QR (TSQR) and Tall and Skinny Cholesky QR (TSCQR) factorizations in MapReduce frameworks.
           This work has looked at data serialization, programming language implementations (C++, Python), numerical stability, and performance
           with faults.  Most work has used the Hadoop cluster on NERSC's Magellan cloud testbed.
	</p>

	The software for this project is available on GitHub:

	<h4><a name="grif">Gamma-ray Imaging Framework (GRIF)</a></h4>
	with Dr. Dan Chivers (LBNL),
        Dr. Mark Bandstra (UC-Berkeley, LBNL),
        <a href="http://bearing.berkeley.edu/">Bearing group</a> (UC-Berkeley, LBNL, SSL),
        <a href="http://donuts.berkeley.edu/">DoNuTS</a> (UC-Berkeley),
        <a href="https://commons.lbl.gov/display/nsd/Applied+Nuclear+Physics">ANP group</a> (LBNL)

	<p>
          The Bearing group is an interdisciplinary effort by students and researchers in nuclear engineering, (astro)physics, mathematics, 
          electrical engineering, and computer science that works on problems in nuclear detection.  The Bearing group is a part
          of the Domestic Nuclear Threat Security Initiative (DoNuTS) at UC-Berkeley.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Currently, the group is developing a parallel, multi-platform software framework for gamma-ray imaging 
          that is used for real-time nuclear detection.  The project is designed to be flexible enough for researchers
          outside of our group to adopt as a common model for detector software support.
          My work has included data analysis, backend architecture, and code generation techniques for the project.
	</p>
          The software is currently closed-source, but an open-source beta release is expected in March 2012.  Stay tuned.

	  <h4><a name="ieor">UC-Berkeley Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a></h4>
          with <a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~hochbaum/">Professor Dorit Hochbaum</a> (UC-Berkeley, USC),
	  <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~barak/">Dr. Barak Fishbain</a> (UC-Berkeley, USC, Technion IIT)
	<p>
	  This project looked at applications of algorithmic methods in computational biology.  We used data sets of
          MRI sequences provided by the OsteoArthritis Initiative
	  <a href="http://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/">(OAI)</a>. 
	  The OAI has an open database of knee scans along with accompanying data about the patients. The patients 
	  were followed over a 48-month period, and data is available over different visits over the time interval. 
	  This turns into a large data mining project for a community of researchers in engineering, computer science, and medicine.
          The project used the sequences to predict knee osteoarthritis development.  The bulk of the algorithmic work was
          image segmentation, where we separated pixels into bone, cartilage, and noise.
